    <p >Thyroid gland hormones are responsible for aiding in digestion as well as maintaining the body moist, balanced, and so on. 
    Thyroid gland treatments such as T3 (triiodothyronine), T4 (thyroid hormone), and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) are used to assess thyroid activity (thyroid stimulating hormone). 
    Thyroid disorder is classified into two types: hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Data mining is a semi-automated method of looking for correlations in massive datasets.
    Machine learning algorithms are one of the best solutions to many problems that are difficult to solve Classification is a data extraction technique (machine learning) used to predict 
    and identify many diseases, such as thyroid disease, which we researched and classified here because machine learning algorithms play a significant role in classifying thyroid disease 
    and because these algorithms are high performing and efficient and aid in classification. Although the application of computer learning and artificial intelligence in medicine dates back 
    to the early days of the field, there has been a new movement to consider the need for machine learning-driven healthcare solutions. As a result, analysts predict that machine learning will 
    become commonplace in healthcare in the near future. Hyperthyroidism is a disorder in which the thyroid gland releases so many thyroid hormones. Hyperthyroidism is caused by an increase in thyroid hormone levels.
    Dry skin, elevated temperature sensitivity, hair thinning, weight loss, increased heart rate, high blood pressure, heavy sweating, neck enlargement, nervousness, menstrual cycles shortening, irregular stomach movements, and hands shaking are some of the signs. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is 
    underactive Hypothyroidism is caused by a decline in thyroid hormone production. Hypo means deficient or less in medical terms. Inflammation and thyroid gland injury are the two primary causes of hypothyroidism. Obesity, low heart rate, increased temperature sensitivity, neck swelling, dry skin, hand numbness, hair issues, 
    heavy menstrual cycles, and intestinal problems are some of the symptoms. If not treated, these symptoms can escalate over time.</p>

In our study, we used machine learning algorithms with thyroid disease. The goal of this study is to categorize thyroid disease

    <p>Thyroid disease is one of the diseases that afflict the world’s population, and the number of cases of this disease is increasing. Because of medical reports that show serious imbalances in thyroid diseases, our study deals with the classification of thyroid disease between hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. This disease was classified using algorithms. 
        Machine learning showed us good results using several algorithms and was built in the form of two models. In the first model, all the characteristics consisting of 16 inputs and one output were taken, and the result of the accuracy of the random forest algorithm was 98.93, which is the highest accuracy among the other algorithms. In the second embodiment, 
        the following characteristics were omitted based on a previous study. The removed attributes were 1- query thyroxine 2- query_hypothyorid 3-query_hyperthyroid. Here we have included the increased accuracy of some algorithms, as well as the retention of the accuracy of others. It was observed that the accuracy of Naive Bayes algorithm increased the accuracy by 90.67. 
        The highest precision of the MLP algorithm was 96.4 accuracy.</p>
